You can now create and send a transition to all players using a macro. There is now a 'Play as Transition' option on the context menu for Journal Entries and it's sheet header. This takes the content and image from the journal and makes a transition out of it with the default settings.

Background size and positioning is now configurable.

### 0.0.4
Fixed some bugs.

### 0.0.3
Hotfix: Socket emit transition did not have preview mode set.

### 0.0.2
Removed preview from form window and instead create live preview transition in the background.

### 0.0.1
Alpha Release
Click Create Transition on scene context menu. Add text, audio, and background image. Set length to show players and whether you want players to be able to close it.
